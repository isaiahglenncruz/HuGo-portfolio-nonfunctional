        utilized knowledge of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, relational databases, the Py4Web web development framework, and Vue.js 
        to create a dynamic website that would aid gamers in finding potential teammates. Utilized a chat system, purely

        Became the major source of inspiration for my interest in utilizing serverless databases for activities 
        concerning machine learning and artificial intelligence. The finished project did not feature explicit serverless 
        computations. Initial attempts to create the resulting self-playing PacMan and PacMan Ghost entities were centered around 
        the usage of deep learning models to create optimal sequences of actions as database entries. The finished units of artifical 
        intelligence used a more simple approach with heuristics to reflexively decide on actions to take.

        As a participant in a public, online, one-week hackathon, utilized knowledge of deep learning and reinforcement learning

        Learned about the necessity of time management when working with huge batches of data - billions of dataset entries were expected to 
        be processed through personal, non-virtual machines.
